## Why Your LearnDash Coupon Code May Not Work

Running into issues at checkout? Here are the most common reasons and quick fixes:

- **Code expired:** Some promotional codes have limited validity periods. Our WPB20 code is valid year-round, but seasonal promotions end quickly.
- **New customers only:** Most LearnDash coupon codes work exclusively for first-time purchases. Renewals are charged at standard rates.
- **Wrong product selected:** Coupon codes for the LMS plugin won't work on StellarSites Learning (cloud hosting) and vice versa.
- **Typo in the code:** Double-check spelling. WPB20 must be entered exactly as shown, with no spaces.
- **Code already used:** Some codes have single-use restrictions per account or email address.
- **Bundle pricing:** Bundled solutions already include built-in discounts and typically cannot be combined with additional coupon codes.
